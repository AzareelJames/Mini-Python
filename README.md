# Mini python
A mini python is a mini version of python.

# How this was made?
It was made from python and it converted to .exe using pyinstaller.
Developers know that exec is dangerous. You can make it safe like this:

data = {} # This stores the data here.
exec("print('hello!')", data)

# Note!
Some features are added or removed.
